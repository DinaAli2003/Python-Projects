## 🔬 Data Analysis Project Methodology

I follow a disciplined, iterative, and accurate approach for every data-driven project to ensure reliable outcomes:

1.  **Business Understanding** 🎯: Clearly defining the problem, objective, and success metrics in collaboration with hypothetical or real stakeholders.
2.  **Data Acquisition & Cleaning** 🧹: Sourcing data (APIs, databases, files), handling outliers and missing values, and performing necessary feature preprocessing.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍: Using statistical plots to analyze data distributions, identify correlations, and extract preliminary insights.
4.  **Feature Engineering & Selection** 🧪: Creating informative new features and applying techniques like correlation matrices for optimal feature selection.
5.  **Evaluation & Interpretation** ✅: Delivering the most powerful insights through python visualizations .
